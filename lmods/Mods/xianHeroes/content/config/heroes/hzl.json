Zi Ling had a tough and unyielding character and a firm determination in the pursuit of the Dao. She was unwilling to be a concubine, had an independent mind, and was very filial. She practiced hard, hoping to take control of her own destiny and have the right to choose her own fate. Zi Ling had the physique of the Pure Yin Body of a Beautiful Maiden, which was most suitable for cultivating the skills of the Demon Race.",
