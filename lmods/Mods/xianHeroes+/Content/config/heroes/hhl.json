			"biography" : "Han Li was originally an ordinary poor boy from a mountain village. Because he possessed spiritual roots and was able to cultivate the Everlasting Spring Art, he was taken as a disciple by Doctor Mo. From then on, he embarked on the path of immortal cultivation.He had a firm will. He wouldn't take any action without potential benefits. He always kept a low profile, didn't care much about face-saving, and never tried to play the hero. He was good at escaping from danger. He was meticulous in his thoughts, had a tenacious mind, was resolute and decisive, could act according to circumstances, and knew when to advance and when to retreat. People called him “Old Devil Han”. Relying on his arduous cultivation all along the way, he finally ascended to the Immortal Realm.",
