Because he was framed, he was expelled from the Medicine Clan. Through his own efforts, Yao Chen became the number one alchemist in the Central Region and possessed the strength at the peak of the Nine-Star Dou Zun. He loved freedom and was unwilling to attach himself to any organization, so he was targeted by the Soul Palace. Yao Chen fell due to the betrayal of his disciple Han Feng, but fortunately, he managed to preserve his soul. Later, he fell into a slumber in the ring until he met Xiao Yan. He helped Xiao Yan with his cultivation and taught him knowledge and cultivation methods. He was an extremely important guide on Xiao Yan's growth path.",
