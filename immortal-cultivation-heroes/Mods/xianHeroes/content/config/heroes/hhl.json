Because he had spiritual roots and could cultivate the Everlasting Spring Art, he was taken as a disciple by Doctor Mo. Since then, he embarked on the path of cultivating immortality.He was firm-willed. He wouldn't take any action without potential benefits. He always kept a low profile, didn't care much about saving face, and wouldn't play the hero. He was good at escaping from danger. He was meticulous in his thoughts, tough-minded, resolute and ruthless. He could act according to circumstances and knew when to advance and when to retreat. People called him “Old Demon Han”. Relying on his arduous cultivation all the way, he finally ascended to the Immortal Realm.",
